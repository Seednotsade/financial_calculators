This line of code is interesting because it uses the loan amount, interest rate, and number of months to figure out a steady monthly payment. Even though it looks complex, itâ€™s just doing the math behind loans that banks and people use all the time. Another interesting factor of this line is the importance. If you mess up a single letter in this line, even if you have thousands of other lines of code, it'll mess everything up.
